            <div id="introtext"> I am currently a Post-doctaral associate at the University of Calgary working with Aditya Nittala. I completed my Ph.D. in Human Computer Interaction at the University of Waterloo advised by Daniel Vogel and Omid Abari. 
                My research interests include Interactive Displays, wearable systems, and haptics. Before starting my Ph.D. 
                I completed my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto and Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from VIT,
                Chennai. <br> <br>
                 I worked as a research assistant in the Dynamics Graphics Project lab (DGP) with Aakar Gupta and Ravin Balakrishnan. During my time at the DGP lab, 
                I worked on using haptics for teaching semaphoric finger gestures and investigated into generating squeeze sensations using shape memory alloys. My Ph.D. thesis focusses on building reconfigurable physical displays. 
                It is a type of display that can customized into an arbitrary shape, size, and resolution using physical pixels.
