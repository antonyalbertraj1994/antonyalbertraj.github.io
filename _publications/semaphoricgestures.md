proj_desc: We studied on using haptic-based learning to teach semaphoric finger gestures. We attached vibration motor on the users finger. Different patterns were generated on the finger to correpond to a finger gesture. We conducted a two day study to test the recall rate of gesture learning using haptics and compared it with visual+haptic and audio methods.
