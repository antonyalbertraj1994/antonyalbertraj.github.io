proj_desc: It is sometimes inconvenient to take the phone out of the pocket to view information from the phone. This retrieval process can be cumbersome when holding a shopping bag and potentially dangerous while biking. So, we explore the idea of directly viewing information through the fabric of a pocket using low-resolution bright LED matrix displays. It is sometimes incovenient and cumbersome to view information from your phone when your An online survey studied the different pocket locations in clothing and the objects stored in them. We also ran a technical experiment to evaluate the ability of LED matrix to shine through 40 different garment fabrics. We also conducted a in-person user study to evaluate our general approach of through-fabric devices, interaction vocabulary, and potential usage scenarios.
